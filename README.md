Statistical Case Study Assignment 2

Workflow:
1. Create the models using KNN, DA and Random forest. 
2. Find the accuracy of each model.
3. Determine if the length of paper affects accuracy of models.
4. Check if different topic affects accuracy of models, by creating a model that does not include 'Art', for example. 

Q1. Machine or Human ? (1000 words models)
Q2. 400/1000 words, change training/test set? which one
Q3. two models(train: 1.whole train set/ 2.except "Architecture").  test set always Architecture
Q4. [undecided] small function words
